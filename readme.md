how did i get into programming?
i really like computer games. i was interested in finding out how they were built and a way to work for a game developer. If anything I would like the freedom to work from home if need be. 

what are my near/far goals with coding dojo:
my goals are to learn software programming to use my creativity to create a game or something that might help others.
